Mathematics 117, Trigonometry, helps students develop skills sufficiently to write and
use the definition of trigonometric functions; sketch the graph of the trigonometric
functions; prove identities; solve trigonometric equations; learn and then apply the law
of the sines and cosines; learn how to write a complex number in trigonometric form
and find all the roots of a complex number; learn polar coordinates system and the
graphs of some simple equations in polar; learn about conic sections (rectangular &
polar), vector (applications & operations), and the exponential and logarithmic
functions with applications and modeling
